Overview of FilOS:
FilOS is a Python-based operating system project that aims to create a simple yet functional environment for users to perform basic operations. It is structured with a focus on user interaction through a shell environment and incorporates various commands and utilities to manage files, directories, and system information.

Core Components:
  Shell (shell.py):
    The shell is the primary interface for the user to interact with the system. It processes user input, executes commands, and returns the output.
    It maintains the state of the current user and directory, providing a prompt that updates based on the user's context.
  Command Processor (commands.py):
    This component houses the definitions for various system commands like ls, cd, mkdir, rmdir, touch, and cat.
    It handles the functionality of navigating and manipulating the file system, creating and deleting directories, creating files, and reading file contents.
  User Management (UserManagement within user_management.py):
    Manages user sessions including login and user creation.
    It likely handles user-specific settings and permissions, ensuring that each user has a personalized and secure environment.
  Login Script (login.py):
    Initiates the user login process, interacting with the User Management system to authenticate users.
    It sets the stage for user interaction with the shell by establishing the user session.
  Functionality:
    File and Directory Management: Users can navigate through directories, create and delete files and directories, and read file contents.
    User Session Management: The system supports user sessions, allowing for login, logout, and possibly user-specific configurations and permissions.
    Interactive Shell: A command-line interface where users can type and execute commands, with the system providing feedback and results.
    Error Handling and Messages: Provides feedback and error messages for user commands, helping guide and inform users about the state of their operations.
Design Considerations:
  Modularity: The system is designed with distinct components handling specific parts of the OS functionality, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability.
  User Experience: Focuses on providing a clear and responsive interface for users, with an emphasis on making common tasks straightforward and efficient.
  Python Ecosystem: Leverages Python's extensive libraries and capabilities to handle system-level operations and file management.
Future Enhancements:
  Networking Capabilities: Adding client-server functionalities or the ability to interact with network resources.
  Expanded Command Set: Including more complex commands and utilities for system information, process management, and possibly scripting capabilities.
  Graphical User Interface (GUI): While currently, the interaction is through a shell, a future direction might include developing a GUI for more intuitive user interaction.
  Performance Optimization: As the system grows, ensuring that the OS remains efficient and responsive will be crucial.
